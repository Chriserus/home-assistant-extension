## Setup

In your Lovelace dashboard, **create a new view** and add a few cards that you want to see in your extension

Here are a few tips: 

- If you have only one card, activate the "panel mode" option for a better look
- If you want to match your browser color scheme, you can choose a specific theme just for this view
- You can completely hide the view if you don't want it to show in your existing dasbhoard, it won't affect the extension
- I suggest you to choose a specific URL for the view. For example: "extension"

**Install** the extension from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/home-assistant/hpoiflhmfklhfcfpibmdmpeonphmdbda)

**Pin** the extension in Chrome so you can access it easily

In the extension options (right-click on the icon > options):
- Set the URL of your view as seen in your browser, for example `https://my-home-assistant.com/lovelace/extension`
- Adjust width and height so everything looks good
- You can choose to crop the upper part of your view to hide the page header. By default, the size of the header is 56 pixels
